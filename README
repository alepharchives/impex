WARNING: UNSTABLE CODE

IMPEX is a new project. The intent is to provide a way to import and export Erlang terms efficiently to and from many native formats by using "form" definitions that parameterize the impex parser, rather than having to write leex/yecc definitions to compile a new parser for each data format instance.

!The export functions are not yet implemented.

For a preview of the intended usage, please refer to file(s) in the docs folder, but note that this is currently provisional documentation, and may change frequently.
