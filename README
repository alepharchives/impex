WARNING: UNSTABLE CODE

IMPEX is a new project. The intent is to provide a way to import and export Erlang terms efficiently to and from many native formats. Impex uses "form" definitions that parameterize the impex parser, avoiding having to write leex/yecc definitions and to compile a new parser for each data format instance. 

I have no idea as yet what the performance impact of this approach will be, but I suspect that a properly optimized impex parser may compare quite well against a precompiled yecc parser...

NOTE: The export functions are not yet implemented.

For a preview of the intended usage, please refer to file(s) in the docs folder, but note that this is currently provisional documentation, and may change frequently.

(impex was created to support functionality required for the GX framework, see: http://github.com/komone/gx).
